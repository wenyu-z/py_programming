sequentially driven by strong growth in the Russia and CIS region where we saw the start over the summer drilling companies in sakhalin together with continued strong activity in Western Siberia\", u' nordc activity was strong in both the UK and Norway as Rick trease rig count increase and summer expiration word began while the recount stabilized in sub-Saharan Africa as activity started to recover on land and with early signs of customers preparing to resume activities on keosha Project Revenue in Latin America increased 9% sequentially driven by solar activity on sales in Mexico and increase exploration and development work in Colombia Argentina Revenue was also higher on increase unconventional Land Development while activity in Brazil and Venezuela remained weak lower sequentially however with the cooperation of Petronas shushufindi production has now turned around and started to recover toward the end of the quarter in the Middle East and Asia Revenue increased 1% sequentially as activity in Egypt I reckon the UAE remain solid we also show C', u\" bouncing activity in China driven by higher sales of completion products and services as well as her SPM gas project in the young Bayfield well drilling activity and product sales also invite Vietnam and Thailand next I would like to provide an update on a recipe and business and rationale behind their ongoing investment program today most of the work we on their take for a customer's continues to be contracted as individual products and services and we do not see this changing in the foreseeable future however building owner abroad technology of rain and deep domain expertise we have overtime also established significant project management and integration capabilities which we offer to our customers through more collaborative and commercial airline business models ESPN business model represents the ultimate alignment with our customers as we take on full field management of their assess risk in the value of our products and services and sometimes\", u' and where we get paid a share of the value generate from incremental production', u' our first SPM project started in 2004 after which we have gradually expanded his business to wear today we manage 15 projects and seven countries in 2016 or SPM business generated 1.4 billion dollars in revenue and has over the period from 2011 - 2016 delivered return on Capital employed which is around 700 basis points higher than the rest of our business dspn business therefore represents the highest multiple we can get on our technical capabilities and in addition these long-term projects have provided a welcome full-cycle Baseline of activity revenue and returns over the past two years we have seen a surge in SPM opportunities from both existing and new customers which we have decided to proactively pursue', u' this is by no means a desire to change the face of a company which will continue to be focused on Market leadership in each individual product line but instead SPM can create a baseline of activities to support a presence in the different geographies we remain confident that despite our drive to expand or SPM business which has a different contract structure comply traditional business we are not significant to changing the risk profile of the company that is because the biggest risk we continue to face as an oilfield products and services company Remains the cyclical nature of our industry', u' ESPN business although different in nature and contractual structures will infect help help them burn the impact of these Cycles provided the project we investing at the necessary to cycle robustness which of course remains a key selection Criterion in all our evaluations through our ongoing investment program we expect to double SPM Revenue over the next two years and overtime make SPM equivalent in size to one of our existing for groups in terms of financials we have made a total capital investment of 4.3 billion dollars in SPM projects since 2012 which represents less than 10% of our cash flow from operations over the same.', u' SPM Investments are currently being amortized at an annual rate of approximately 450 million dollars and the amortization schedules are periodically reviewed and adjusted to match Project Life and economics the current investment in SPM projects on a balance sheet is 2.6 billion dollars', u' in the last 12 months we have announced future multi investment plans of 390 million dollars with vibe in Argentina and seven hundred million dollars with first EMP and nnpc Nigeria in addition we have started up smaller projects with SM energy in the Powder River Basin in the US and we storkson in western Canada going forward we will do our newly established Venture fund look to access an increasing amount of external funding for SPM business to the refinancing of existing project wear today we carry 100% of the Project funding End by inviting Financial investors to take a share in an upcoming project so in summary or SPM investment program is focused on establishing a full cycle activity revenue and financial Baseline in many of the countries we operating as well as continue to sleep provides providing accretive returns when compared', u' to our base business all no turn the call back over to bowl', u\" thank you Patrick so next let's turn to the only Market where sustained growth in demand continues to provide a much-needed foundation for the Outlook leaving little reason for concern over this part of the oil Market equation\", u\" Lee Supply style ever it's far more complex with Market nervousness an investor speculations January overshadowing Saxon physical fundamentals leading to unpredictable movement in all the prices in spite of a third year of global Investments II u.s. land and serve the rest of the world\", u' the Oppa goes countries in Russia which combined make up close to 40% of global oil production remain fully committed to sound and consistent stewardship of their resource base this is reflected in the steady increase in activity over the past three years as the best absorbed the significant', u' these countries are also actively supporting the rebalancing of the global oil Market by taking a proactive role in moderating their current production levels', u' the other two books of Supply are currently pursuing diametrically opposed directions to both investment and Resource Management driven by the respective stakeholders', u' Seabrook from the u.s. 90 MP companies which currently represent around 8% of global oil supply is largely driven by the US Equity investors who are encouraging enabling and rewarding in projects', u' the hospital from us blind are facilitated by a factory approached about drilling and production and supported by a rapidly scalable supplier industry with a low barrier to entry in this market the pursuit of appreciation free cash flow 40 cool the Ottomans', u' turn off local producers making up the rest of the world today represents over 50% of global oil production and Culver at Broad and diverse group of ioc Anderson Independent operators in aggregate this group is for the third successive year highly focused on meeting the cash returned expectations of their shareholders whether these are Equity investors or goblins The Operators meet these requirements by striving to keep production slapped by producing their existing outfits harder than normal and by limiting Investments to God provides short-term contributions to production at the expense of increasing the piece-rate', u\" these produces have also benefited from a production Penguin on 5 to $700,000 per day in each of the past three years coming from new projects where the majority of the Investments Romania's yes\", u' I need a low rate of new projects being sanctioned in 2014 this Palin will taper off in the coming years', u' this harvesting approach is not uncommon for conventional oil fields that are in their last years of life prior to being permanently shut in', u' however this Investments dealership mode is not sustainable for a last resource base that is both expected and required to provide a substantial part of global oil production for decades to come needless to say the longer the current underinvestment carries on the most severe that clip like the crying fan would likely be when the producers run out of protrim options to maintain production and give it to the production base']\n"
